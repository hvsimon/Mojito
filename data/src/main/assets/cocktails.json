    "intro": "The refreshingly minty-citrus flavours of Cuba's Mojito cocktail perfectly compliment white Rum & is wonderful on a hot summer's day. Highly popular, yet tricky to get right & often served too sweet - the key to a good Mojito is to use plenty of fresh Mint & Lime juice but not too much Sugar.",
    "steps": [
      "Place the Mint, Sugar Syrup & Lime wedges into a highball glass & lightly muddle the ingredients together. The Lime wedges & Mint leaves should be bruised to release their juices & essential oils.",
      "Fill the glass with crushed ice, pour over the White Rum & stir.",
      "Top up with Soda Water & stir well from the bottom up.",
      "Garnish with a sprig of Mint & serve with a straw."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Given that the Mojito is reliant on fresh Limes & Mint that are available in different sizes & flavour intensity, it is a cocktail that really rewards you if you tune the quantities to accommodate the ingredients you have available & most importantly, your own personal tastes.",
      "If you make a Mojito & find it too sweet, you could try adding Angostura bitters to cut down on the sweetness.",
      "Don't have any Limes to hand? Try using Lemons for a twist on the classic Mojito but note that you might need to add a little more Sugar Syrup or use a little less Lemon to balance out the extra sourness.",
      "If you're out of Sugar syrup, you can use half a teaspoon of fine caster Sugar instead. If using Sugar, you might like to add the White Rum & stir to dissolve the Sugar before adding the crushed Ice.",
      "Don't have crushed ice? Originally, Cuban bartenders mixed the drink using cubed ice, including mint stalks as well as leaves - try this for an equally tasty yet more rustic feel."
